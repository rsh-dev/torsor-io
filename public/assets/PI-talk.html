Quantum programming sucks. It's low-level, bug-ridden, and maddening
to have to think in qubits, which is essentially machine code in
braket notation. Finding better ways to talk to quantum
computers is a nice research problem because
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it's way easier than actually <i>building</i> the dang thing;
</li>
<li>very few people are thinking about this;
</li>
<li>it will probably make all of our lives more pleasant;
</li>
<li>in the best case, it could actually be useful!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's my general motivation for working on this.
Today, I want to tell you about a possible solution, but less from a
practical software standpoint and more from the formal standpoint of
logic and algebra. Here's a very minimal outline:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we talk about some dualities in math and logic;
</li>
<li>we revisit these in the context of circuits;
</li>
<li>we arrive at a new way of looking at quantum computing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is work in progress, and that your feedback will help me make even better! So
please pepper me with questions, comments, and suggestions for improvement.

Classical (propositional) logic is all about how to break logical statements
down into their components. We represent propositions as variables
like \(p, q, r, \ldots\), and join
them together with <i>connectives</i> like \(\texttt{AND}\) (\(\wedge\)),
\(\texttt{OR}\) (\(\vee\)), \(\texttt{XOR}\) (\(\oplus\)), \(\texttt{NOT}\) (\(\neg\)) and
\(\texttt{IMPLIES}\) (\(\to\)):
\[
p \wedge q, \quad q \to r, \quad r \vee q, \quad \neg p.
\]
The set of formulas created from a set of propositional variables
\(\mathbb{P}\) by connectives is denoted \(\mathbb{F}_{\mathcal{P}}\), or
simply \(\mathcal{F}\).
There are two ways to check if a logical formula is correct. The first
is to use <i>syntax</i>, which usually means a proof system. These take
many forms, but Gentzen's "natural deduction", which has introduction
and elimination rules for connectives, are probably the easiest to
use. For instance, for \(\to\) these are the (perhaps) familiar rules
of <i>modus ponens</i> and <i>condtional proof</i>:
\[
\frac{\Gamma \vdash A, \, A \to B}{\Gamma \vdash B} \,\,(\to\! \text{E}),
\quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash [A]_a, \cdots, B}{\Gamma \vdash A \to
B} \,\,(\to\! \text{I}: a),
\]
where \(\cdots\) means that we deduce \(B\) conditional on assuming \(A\) at
line \(a\). Also \(\Gamma\) is
a set of formulas, \(A, B \in \mathcal{F}\) and
\(\vdash\) is the <i>syntactic turnstile</i>. A <i>theorem</i> is a formula which follows from the
empty set, e.g. \(\vdash p \to p\), since starting with \(p\) we deduce \(p\).
</p>

<p>
This is a purely formal affair. The second way involves <i>semantics</i>,
i.e. how we interpret a formula. For classical propositional logic,
this means assigning <i>truth values</i> \(\{0, 1\} = \mathbb{Z}_2\).
A <i>valuation</i> is just an assignment of truth
values to each propositional variable, \(v \in
\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{P}}\). We then figure out truth values for
compound formulas by recursion, i.e. if \(\mathcal{F}\) is
the set of formulas, \(v\) determines an assigment \(\phi_v \in
\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{F}}\). As an example,
\[
\phi_v(A \vee B) = \max\{\phi_v (A), \phi_v (B)\}, \quad
\phi_v (\neg A) = 1 - \phi_v(A).
\]
We write \(\Gamma \vDash A\) if any time a valuation assigns
\(\phi (\gamma) = 1\) to
all elements of \(\gamma \in \Gamma\), it assigns \(\phi(A)=1\). The
symbol \(\vDash\) is called the <i>semantic turnstile</i>, and a formula that
is always true, for any valuation, is called <i>valid</i>. As an example,
\(\vDash p \vee \neg p\) since one of \(p\) and \(\neg p\) is assigned \(1\).
</p>

<p>
Note that, for formulas over a finite set of propositional variables
\(\mathcal{P}\), we only need to consider the \(2^{|\mathcal{P}|}\) binary
assignments for those variables. Enumerating these assignments we get
what is called a <i>truth table</i>, introduced by no less venerable a
figure than Wittgenstein. The truth table has a bit more structure
than meets the eye. Given a formula \(A\), we can restrict to the
subset of the truth table that makes it true, so
\[
\phi(A) = 1,
\]
which we usually just write as \(A \in \phi\).
For instance, restricting to the entries for which \(p\) is true cuts
the table in half, or <i>filters</i> it. (This is a technical term we won't
dwell on.)
There is a lovely structural correspondence between filters and
logic, but to see it, we'll need to introduce some algebra
and topology!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Boolean algebra</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
First, we'll need to translate this classical logical jazz into the language of algebra.
The basic idea is to view propositional variables \(\mathcal{P}\) as unknowns, and do high-school
algebra with them, adding and multiplying according to the usual
rules, e.g.
\[
p(q + r) = pq + pr.
\]
We can then define logical connectives using algebra:
\[
p \wedge q = pq, \quad \neg r = I - r, \quad p \oplus q = p + q.
\]
Here, \(I\) is a special identity variable satisfying \(I\cdot \phi=
\phi\), and we can scalar multiply by elements of \(\mathbb{Z}_2 =
\mathbb{F}_2\), where we now view this as the field of \(2\)
elements. Thus, our algebra \(\mathcal{B}\) is not merely a
vector space over \(\mathbb{F}_2\) but a commutative ring (associative,
distributive, commutative product, etc). We need one
more thing to make it Boolean, however, namely the property of <i>idempotence</i>:
\[
p^2 = p.
\]
Logically, this makes sense because \((p \wedge p) \leftrightarrow
p\); arithmetically, it makes sense because variables takes values in
\(\mathbb{F}_2\).
</p>

<p>
This formulation gives us access to the tools and concepts of algebra,
and with a more effort, topology.
First, note that the field \(\mathbb{F}_2\) itself forms a Boolean
algebra with no variables, \(\mathcal{B}_{\varnothing}\).
The valutions \(\phi\) on formulas that we were talking about before are
not just any old function; the recursion rules ensure it is a
structure-preserving map, or <i>homomorphism</i> from the Boolean algebra
\(\mathcal{B}\) to the trivial algebra \(\mathbb{F}_2\):
\[
\phi(A + B) = \phi(A) + \phi(B), \quad \phi(A)\phi(B) = \phi(A)\phi(B).
\]
We'll call this set of maps
\[
S(\mathcal{B}) = \text{Hom}(\mathcal{B}, \mathbb{F}_2).
\]
In logical terms, \(S(\mathcal{B})\) is just the set of entries in the
truth table! The <i>filters</i> we talked about before are sets
\[
\mathcal{O}_A = \{\phi \in S(\mathcal{B}) : A \in \phi\}.
\]
We will take these as the <i>basis</i> of a topology, i.e. they generate
the collection open sets by union. With the resulting topology,
\(S(\mathcal{B})\) is called a <i>Stone space</i> after Marshall
Stone. It has the following defining properties (proof omitted!):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hausdorff (any two points have disjoint neighbourhoods);
</li>
<li>totally disconnected (only singletons are connected); and
</li>
<li>compact (any cover has a finite subcover).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because \(A \notin \phi\) just in case \(\neg\phi \in \phi\), we have
\[
\mathcal{O}_{\neg A} = \overline{\mathcal{O}_A},
\]
where \(\overline{U}\) is the complement.
Hence, our basic filters \(\mathcal{O}_\phi\) are not only open, but
closed, so <i>clopen</i>. Stone proved these are the <i>only</i> clopen sets,
which shows that the clopen sets of the Stone space \(S(\mathcal{B})\)
are in one-to-one correspondence with the Boolean algebra
\(\mathcal{B}\).
In fact, these clopen sets form a Boolean algebra with e.g.
\[
U \vee V = U \cup V, \quad \neg U = \overline{U}.
\]
This algebra is isomorphic!
This result is called the <i>Stone representation theorem</i>, because
it tells us that we can faithfully represent an abstract Boolean
algebra with a concrete filter structure on the truth
table.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Gelfand duality</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
How far can we push this? There is a nice reformulation of the clopen
sets that paves the way for a more general result.
The set
\[
\mathcal{O}_A = \{\phi \in S(\mathcal{B}) : \phi(A) = 1\}
\]
can be identified with a binary function \(\hat{A}\) on
\(S(\mathcal{B})\), simply by setting
\[
\hat{A}(\phi) = \phi(A).
\]
We just swapped things around! It's a dumb trick, but turns out to be
incredibly useful. In functional analysis, it is called the <i>Gelfand
representation</i>, and gives rise to the Fourier transform, Mellin
transform, and other such deep things. Moreover, this isn't just any
binary function; since \(\hat{A}^{-1}(1) = \mathcal{O}_A\) and
\(\hat{A}^{-1}(0) = \mathcal{O}_{\neg A}\), the inverse image of open
sets is open and the map is <i>continuous</i>. Since all homomorphisms are
of this form, we have
\[
\mathcal{B} \cong C_0[S(\mathcal{B})],
\]
where \(C_0\) is the set of continuous binary functions, and \(\cong\)
is an isomorphism of algebras given by the Gelfand
representation. (Incidentally, I've never seen this stated anywhere!)
</p>

<p>
We've been working over the field \(\mathbb{F}_2\), which makes sense
for Boolean logic. The next simplest field is \(\mathbb{C}\) (the real
numbers are trickier because they have algebraic "holes"). Consider a
commutative algebra \(\mathcal{A}\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), so as before,
it's a vector space with scalar
multiplication over \(\mathbb{C}\) and forms a commutative ring.
Homomorphisms \(\phi: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{C}\) are linear and
multiplicative, just like valuations:
\[
\phi(AB) = \phi(A)\phi(B), \quad \phi(\alpha A + \beta B) =
\alpha\phi(A) + \beta \phi(B).
\]
These homomorphisms are called <i>characters</i> rather than valuations,
and together, they form what is called the <i>spectrum</i> of the algebra,
which we write \(\text{Spec}(\mathcal{A}) =
\text{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\mathbb{C})\).
Different field, different names, but the structure is very similiar!
The Gelfand representation associates to
an element \(A \in \mathcal{A}\) a function \(\hat{A}: \text{Spec}(\mathcal{A}) \to
\mathbb{C}\) defined by swapping,
\[
\hat{A}(\phi) = \phi(A),
\]
just like we did above.
Following the analogy, the spectrum \(\text{Spec}(\mathcal{A})\) is the "truth
table" for the commutative algebra \(\mathcal{A}\), and the functions
\(\hat{A}\) are continuous functions on the truth table.
</p>

<p>
For Boolean algebras, the Gelfand map is an isomorphism.
For a general commutative algebra, this isn't necessarily the case; to
make it true, we need some condition analogous to idempotence.
The necessary condition is a bit more involved, and we need to add a
new operation \(\ast:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}\), an
involutive automorphism which generalizes complex conjugation:
\[
A^{**} = A, \quad (AB)^* =
B^*A^*, \quad (\alpha A + \beta B)^* = \alpha^* A^* + \beta^* B^*.
\]
We also need to measure the size of elements use the <i>operator
norm</i>, i.e. the maximum absolute eigenvalue:
\[
\Vert A \Vert = \sup \{|\lambda| : \lambda \in \mathbb{C}, \, A - \lambda I
\text{ is not invertible}\} = \sup\{|\lambda| : \lambda \in
\text{spec}(A)\}.
\]
(We use lower case "spec" for the spectrum of an operator.)
The \(\ast\) operation must be norm-preserving, \(\Vert A^* \Vert = \Vert
A \Vert\), but the special condition equivalent to idempotence is
something called the <i>C* identity</i>:
\[
\Vert A A^*\Vert = \Vert A \Vert^2.
\]
Equipped with such a \(\ast\) operation, \(\mathcal{A}\) becomes a <i>commutative C* algebra</i>.
The Gelfand representation, like the Stone representation, is an
isomorphism, with
\[
\mathcal{A} \cong C_0[\text{Spec}(\mathcal{A})]
\]
where \(\cong\) indicates not only that they are isomorphic as
algebras (homomorphisms each way), but the norm is the same.
Often, this is written
\[
\mathcal{A} \cong C_0[\Phi]
\]
where \(\Phi\) is the spectrum, which viewed as a topological space is
locally compact and Hausdorff (a bit like the Stone space).
If the analogue of the set of switches \(\mathcal{P}\) is finite, then
the spectrum is a vector space \(\mathbb{C}^{|\mathcal{P}|}\) on which
the algebra acts diagonally.
The moral of the story: in the same way an abstract Boolean algebra
can be realized concretely using continuous functions on the truth table, a
commutative C* algebra can be realized using
continuous functions on the spectrum, which in simple cases takes the
form of a finite-dimensional vector space.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
At this point, it hopefully feels natural to ask what happens when the
product is <i>noncommutative</i>, so that
\[
A \cdot B \neq B \cdot A
\]
in general. If the C* condition and all the other axioms still hold,
this will form a <i>noncommutative C* algebra</i>.
It can no longer be the case that such an algebra, say \(\mathcal{A}\),
is isomorphic to continuous complex-valued functions on a space \(\Phi\),
since these functions necessarily commute:
\[
(A\cdot B)(\phi) = A(\phi) B(\phi) = B(\phi) A(\phi)
\]
for \(\phi \in \Phi\).
We observed before that, in the commutative case, the algebra for
a finite-dimensional spectrum can be represented by diagonal
linear operators. Here, we simply replace diagonal operators by
bounded ones! In other words, we expect the spectrum to be a vector
space on which the algebra \(\mathcal{A}\) acts like matrices.
</p>

<p>
This intuition is right, but the details are a little more complicated.
Before, we defined the spectrum as the set of characters, essentially
the one-dimensional representations of \(\mathcal{A}\), i.e. on \(\mathbb{C}\).
Similarly, we now try to construct the spectrum as the set of
representations of \(\mathcal{A}\) acting on some Hilbert
space. It turns out that these can built from objects called <i>states</i>
\(\phi \in \Phi_{\mathcal{A}}\), defined as unital linear
functionals:
\[
\phi(\alpha A + \beta B) = \alpha \phi(A) + \beta \phi(B), \quad
\phi(I) = 1.
\]
There is a lovely construction due to Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS)
showing how to explicitly build, for each state \(\phi\):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}_\phi\);
</li>
<li>a ring homomorphism \(\mathcal{\pi}_\phi: \mathcal{A} \to
  \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_\phi)\) from \(\mathcal{A}\) to bounded
operators on \(\mathcal{H}_\phi\);
</li>
<li>and finally, a vector \(\xi_\phi \in \mathcal{H}_\phi\)
which reproduces the linear functional \(\phi\) from <i>expectations</i>:
\[
  \phi(A) = \langle \pi_\phi(A) \xi_\phi, \xi_\phi\rangle.
  \]
</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point, we have a disorganized collection of representations.
It turns out that states form a convex set (by the Banach–Alaoglu
theorem), and the extreme points of this set \(\partial\Phi_{\mathcal{A}}\) correspond to
<i>irreducible representations (irreps)</i>, which cannot be broken down into direct
sums of others. The direct sum of representations
\[
\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}} = \bigoplus_{\phi \in
\partial\Phi_{\mathcal{A}}} \mathcal{H}_{\phi}, \quad \pi_{\mathcal{A}} = \bigoplus_{\phi \in
\partial\Phi_{\mathcal{A}}} \pi_\phi
\]
is <i>faithful</i>, with \(\mathcal{A}\) is isometrically isomorphic to the bounded
operators acting on \(\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}\),
\[
\mathcal{A} \cong \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}),
\]
with a map given by \(\pi_{\mathcal{A}}\). This is a bit harder to grok
than the earlier examples, but secretly, it's pretty similar. Earlier,
we built a space from characters,
irreducible representations that happened to be one-dimensional, and this
time we built it from irreducible representations that "blew up" into
Hilbert spaces of potentially many dimensions. The states turns out to be the key tool; they are
the analogue of the truth table.

So far, all of this has been math. The point was to lay out a nice set of
analogies taking us from Boolean algebra to noncommutative C*
algebras.
Now, however, we want to switch gears and think about the physics of
these different setups; the punchline will be a different way of doing
quantum computing.

Let's return to Boolean algebras. In the 30s, various people, most
prominently Claude Elwood Shannon, realized you could implement logic
on a circuit. His idea was to replace propositional variables
\(\mathcal{P}\) by <i>switches</i> that could be turned on or off. Connecting
switches in series corresponds to \(\texttt{AND}\), or the product in
the Boolean algebra:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./PI-img/shannon0.png" alt="lumu" align="center" width="250px" style="display:inline;margin:-70px 0 -70px 0;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, connecting them in series corresponds to \(\texttt{OR}\),
which (as Shannon points out) can be interpreted as \(+\).
Shannon was interested in using Boolean algebra to simplify the design
of switching circuits. As a very simple example, we can take this
complicated beast
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./PI-img/shannon1.png" alt="lumu" align="center" width="350px" style="display:inline;margin:-50px 0 -50px 0;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
and reduce it to this:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./PI-img/shannon2.png" alt="lumu" align="center" width="350px" style="display:inline;margin:-60px 0 -60px 0;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
(Note that \('\) indicates \(\texttt{NOT}\).) He does many other things
besides, but this is a key insight: by translating the physical
structure of the circuit into algebra, we can use math to optimize the
design. In fact, we can map proof systems like the natural deduction
rules I mentioned above to optimization routines. This is a primitive instance of the
<i>Curry-Howard isomorphism</i>, which tells us that proofs are programs.
</p>

<p>
This is the syntactic side of things; in the images above, switches
are "unknowns", just like high school algebra, and we reason
symbolically. But what about semantics?
Entries in the truth table are just definite states of the switches. A
switch is "on" (nonzero conductance) iff the corresponding variable is
assigned \(1\) and "off" (zero conductance) iff the variable is assigned \(0\).
The conductance of the component switches determine the overall
conductance of the circuit.
This is all kind of obvious, but what's cool is that here is where
physics, and specifically <i>compositional measurement</i>, makes its appearance.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Shannon used this binary measurement of "hindrance" (conductance), but
we can imagine replacing switches wih variable resistors \(\mathcal{P}\), connecting
them in series and parallel as before, and making exact conductance
measurements. The rules for conductance \(G\) follow from the rules for
resistance:
\[
G_\text{parallel}(p, q) = G(p)+G(q), \quad
G_\text{series}(p, q) = \frac{G(p)G(q)}{G(p)+G(q)} = G_\text{series}(q, p),
\]
where we are using the fact that \(G(p), G(q) \in \mathbb{R}\) to
swap the order.
We need to ban short circuits to make sure the conductance doesn't
blow up (having positive conductance is enough), but with that
proviso, we can embed our circuits in a commutative C* algebra.
</p>

<p>
In the first course on circuits, we spend a lot of time finding
"equivalent resistance"; under the hood, we are implementing some
version of the Curry-Howard isomorphism over a commutative C* algebra.
This is the amusingly Bourbaki way of viewing high school circuits!
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./PI-img/cube.png" alt="lumu" align="center" width="200px" style="display:inline;margin:-30px 0 -30px 0;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
But the serious point is that there is a precise analogy to what
Shannon was doing.
If high school resistor problems are the syntax, what is the semantics?
Instead of assigning a truth value to each switch, we assign
conductance or resistance to
each variable resistor in the set \(\mathcal{P}\). 
The algebra acts continuously on this set by Gelfand duality. Since a
symbolic expression is just a circuit, this means we continuously
assign an equivalent resistance once we assign resistance to each
element of \(\mathcal{P}\).
Once again, it's a story of compositional
observation.
</p>

<p>
We can imagine playing the same game with any set of classical
observations. The set \(\mathcal{P}\) of "propositional variables" would
be atomic measurements or things we directly control, like the
switches and variable resistors. A circuit maps the variables
\(\mathcal{P}\) into a commutative C* algebra. The elements of
\(\mathcal{P}\) are essentially <i>generators</i> of the algebra. We can use
syntactic manipulations, including laws of physics represented by an assumption set \(\Gamma\), to
simplify the circuit layouts. The set \(\Gamma\) represents <i>relations</i>,
and we write
\[
\mathcal{A} = \langle \mathcal{P} | \Gamma\rangle_\text{comm} =
\langle \mathcal{P} | \Gamma\cup \mathcal{P}_\text{comm}\rangle,
\]
for the corresponding algebra, where \(\mathcal{P}_\text{comm}\) are
relations to the effect that all variables commute.
On the semantic side, we have a device interface (switches, variable
resistors, etc) which lets us pluck out a line of the truth table. The
compositional part of the semantics is realized by Nature itself.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">

Given the leadup, you can guess what happens next: we consider
noncommutative circuits. We'll have a set of noncommutative variables
\(\mathcal{P}\), and a set of assumptions or relations \(\Gamma\), which
together make a noncommutative C* algebra:
\[
\mathcal{A} = \langle \mathcal{P} | \Gamma\rangle.
\]
We can draw circuits, with the simplest convention being Shannon's,
i.e. variables in series denotes products and in parallel denote
sums. We can also add numbers in circles to represent multiples of the
identity:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./PI-img/circuit-laws.png" alt="lumu" align="center" width="350px" style="display:inline;margin:-40px 0 -30px 0;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We employ algebraic reasoning on the syntactic side. The semantics is
a bit more interesting, though. A line in the truth table now corresponds
to an irrep; irreps correspond to extreme elements of the set of
states \(\Phi_{\mathcal{A}}\), also called <i>pure states</i>.
The topology of this convex blob is hard to reason about, and Størmer
found a nicer way: to each state \(\phi \in \Phi_{\mathcal{A}}\) we can
associate a family of <i>sharp</i> or zero variance operators:
\[
\mathcal{S}_\phi = \{A \in \mathcal{A}: \Delta_\rho^2 A =
\rho(|A|^2)-|\rho(A)|^2 = 0\}.
\]
The pure states are those for which \(\mathcal{S}_\phi\) is <i>maximal</i>,
i.e. cannot be extended. In terms of ordinary linear algebra, this is
just an eigenstate. In terms of logic, this is an element of the truth
table. And from the perspective of measurement, it will specify an
exact observation (or observations) from which a
compound measurement can be derived.
</p>

<p>
We can link back to Boolean algebra in an elegant way. Recall the
spectrum of an operator:
\[
\text{spec}(A) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : A - \lambda I \quad
\text{not invertible}\}.
\]
We can determine these using the minimal polynomial. An important
example is <i>projectors</i>, Hermitian operators satisfying
\[
\Pi^2 - \Pi = \Pi(\Pi - I) = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{spec }
\Pi = \{0, 1\}.
\]
These correspond to binary measurements (you're in or out of a closed
subspace) but also gives the noncommutative version of the idempotence condition!
Von Neumann and Birkhoff used this to develop the theory of <i>quantum logic</i>, by
analogy with the lattice-theoretic treatment of classical logic.
But this ultimately ended up as a bit of a mathematical dead-end; it
seems we need the full richness of C* algebras to get something
interesting, e.g. quantum computing.
But that's a talk for another day!

Instead, I want to finish with a fun speculation.
We can summarize the analogies so far in the form of an equation:
\[
\frac{\text{syntax}}{\text{semantics}} =
\frac{\text{algebra}}{\text{geometry}} =
\frac{\text{programs}}{\text{measurement}}.
\]
The first lies in the domain of logic, the second math, and the last
physics (with "computation" understood in the sense of interpretable physi).
A natural question is: what is the common ratio?
A wild guess is <i>Isbell duality</i>, encapsulated by a scary-looking commutative diagram:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./PI-img/Isbell_duality.png" alt="lumu" align="center" width="350px" style="display:inline;margin:-40px 0 -40px 0;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the diagram, we have a few things going on:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\mathcal{A}\) is playing the role of algebra;
</li>
<li>\(\mathcal{V}\) the role of vector space;
</li>
<li>\(y\) is the Yoneda embedding and \(z\) the dual Yoneda embedding;
</li>
<li>\(\mathcal{O}\) the "algebra of operators" functor akin to \(C_0\) and \(\mathcal{B}\);
</li>
<li>\(\text{Spec}\) the "spectrum" functor as above.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The diagram just states a categorical version of the Gelfand swap: for
every object \(A, B\) of \(\mathcal{A}\),
\[
\text{Hom}_{[\mathcal{A},\mathcal{V}]^\text{op}}(\mathcal{O} z(A), y(B))
\cong\text{Hom}_{[\mathcal{A}^\text{op},\mathcal{V}]}(z(A), \text{Spec }y(B)),
\]
William Lawvere wrote that this link is "the first step toward expressing the duality between space
and quantity fundamental to mathematics".
These make the most sense in the context of mathematics; are probably
related to Stone duality for logic; and for computation I have no idea.
But the links <i>between</i> analogies are also interesting:

</div>

<p>
The links were historically made between dark names, but by virtue of
 Isbell duality also link light names.
The end result is a richly suggestive web of dualities; could be a fun thing to
 explore further! And it never hurts to sink your foundations deeper;
 it tends to make the house more stable.
