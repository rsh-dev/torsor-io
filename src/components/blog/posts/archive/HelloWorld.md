Truly transformative research is not born in the Ivory Tower or the boardroom: it's a chemical reaction between great problems and great ideas. Too often, institutions separate these elements from one another, and like flame without oxygen, real activity quickly ceases. Drawing inspiration from Bell Labs, we believe that the most profound innovations emerge when brilliant minds respond to the stimulus of great problems. The innovations necessary to solve these problems cannot be coerced into being; brilliance must be given the freedom to explore, collaborate, and dream big. Idea-making is an agricultural process, not a mechanical one.

In that spirit, we announce Redshift Labs, a company that brings great ideas and great problems together and lets innovation grow organically. Our mission is ambitious but easy to state: shift reality. Problems are parts of reality we want to shift; ideas are levers; Redshift can hopefully be an Archimedean fulcrum from which to move the world.

By themselves, ideas are not enough. We're also building tools that will fundamentally transform how we compute, secure, and understand our world, starting with [Yaw](https://rsh.dev/#yaw), our next-generation quantum computing platform. It will allow users to program quantum computers in a new and more expressive way, simplify access to quantum hardware, and allow for the creation of genuinely high-level quantum software.

But this is just the beginning. We're assembling a team of dreamers, builders, and pioneers who share our vision of how to change the world with ideas.

Welcome to Redshift Labs. Let's shift reality together.
