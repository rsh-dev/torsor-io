Reality has symmetries, but finding them requires drawing the right maps. This insight lies at the heart of a "torsor", a term coming from the French *torseur* for "twister". John Baez has a [nice explainer](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/torsors.html), but the basic idea is simple: it looks like a group, but without the labels, coordinates, or landmarks a group usually comes with. It's a bit like a mathematical version of the map/territory distinction. This is how research works. The universe is full of pattern and structure, but we need to map it out ourselves. Science is cartography.

The "twister" part comes from the fact that torsors allow the map to *change*. A familar example is the globe revolving on its axis; at each point in time, it's a sphere, but from moment to moment the description *twists*. This idea of shifting, connected patterns of symmetry is another basic phenomenon of research. Insights from one realm can often be ported directly to another, provided we draw the right maps and think big. So, "torsor" neatly packages some crucial insights into the nature of reality and scientific research.

**Torsor Labs** is a place we'll be drawing these maps. We hope to solve real problems, but let the maps dictate those problems rather than the other way round. Our initial focus is on a new high-level approach to quantum programming, but that's just the beginning. If you're interested in [joining our team](https://torsor.io/#team) or [exploring research possibilities](https://torsor.io/#consulting), we'd love to hear from you.

Welcome to Torsor Labs. Reality is beautifully twisted.
